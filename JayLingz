jay lingy dingy he looked cute when he was deep in thought.....thinkers ..heh.........which was often times........like he would be analysing games......as all greats do who were first talented and needed to develop into their great versions (unlike his teammate Anny Janny who is now in a shit ass team, that loser dumbass).....he would be watching deeply and would go like......yeah here the inside forward cuts inside to create.....create a goal...a scoring chance...clearly cut even..........ole mourinho taught him that ....... yeah when he was younger.......yeah the winger beats the fullback.....he does a trick.....,..... the centre back crawls.....rich stream of information stemming from a single footballing action.....i see it all and........i must do it all he would say.................i started wondering myself..........if a player was a god what would he play like..........i reckon he would score sam good fakin goals ......well jay liggy does do that even without being fully developed footballer yet......heh.....but i digress heh.........see,.. my dog jayligz was not only talented in the body...... but in mind too......... that kid had some real mind power..........he would make you smart just by being in his presence......... yeah........before meeting him i didn't love football...... though it was for gays....... i realise now that i just didn't use to get it..........young jay ligga.......... has it all.......body and mind.......
us regular mortals........we should just shut up and drink our coffee and let the talent speak.....and we shut up......and watch.........like i was shut up while watching jayling having leant his head on the train window thinking his thoughts...... even thinking my thoughts...... and me thinking my thoughts as well.....in a retrospective mood but looking from the future.......i see a based goat before me....there is still time untill bloomth.....im glad I'm here to witness his maturation.......body and mind.........like wine.......

jay lingy he did use to become real angery when a defender dared to try to get the ball from him....of course they never could but... but Philly he ....... once he managed to touch the ball while Lingz was on it....yeah toepoked it.......lingo, well, he didn't appreciate that.. . .... usually ling used to take it easy in training.......but after that... he'd let Phil have it......and oh boy.......humiliating......Jess liked to make him crawl....yeah all fours....once while Philly was on the ground he stepped on his fingers, crushed them........MAKE ME A FUNNY FACE! You could hear the sound of fingerbones crackling as Lingard pressed his studs harder and harder. Phil was contorting his face in unimaginable ways, hoping to please Jesse enough to let go. Jesse finally released his hand but he was not done yet... Before Jones could stand up Jesse kicked him as hard as he could in the belly....... PLAY DEAD!...Jones collapsed in fetal position. But he could not play dead as he was shivering, struggling to hold in his vomit. PLAY DEAD!!!...and another forceful kick. Jones barfed. BITCH! LICK IT UP CUNT! LICK IT UP AND MAKE A FUNNY FACE!....... GOOD BOY! HAHAHAHAHAHAH! YEAH FUCKER! WHEN YOU'RE DONE WE'RE DOING A REPEAT! ALRIGHT??..... SAY YES MASTER!...yes master........THANK YOU MASTER JLINGZ...thank you master jaylingz.....THUD - another kick, right to the head.....jesse pulled a leash out of his back pocket and put it on Phil's neck and walked him around the training ground....dragged I should say........this went on while everyone was watching......they were saying amongst themselves.....yeah serves him right for trying to ruin jesses confidence by taking the ball from him........and that was that for the new maldini....that was that......
