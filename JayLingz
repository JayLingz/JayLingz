jay lingy dingy he looked cute when he was deep in thought.....thinkers ..heh.........which was often times........like he would be analysing games......as all greats do who were first talented and needed to develop into their great versions (unlike his teammate Anny Janny who is now in a shit ass team, that loser dumbass).....he would be watching deeply and would go like......yeah here the inside forward cuts inside to create.....create a goal...a scoring chance...clearly cut even..........ole mourinho taught him that ....... yeah when he was younger.......yeah the winger beats the fullback.....he does a trick.....,..... the centre back crawls.....rich stream of information stemming from a single footballing action.....i see it all and........i must do it all he would say.................i started wondering myself..........if a player was a god what would he play like..........i reckon he would score sam good fakin goals ......well jay liggy does do that even without being fully developed footballer yet......heh.....but i digress heh.........see,.. my dog jayligz was not only talented in the body...... but in mind too......... that kid had some real mind power..........he would make you smart just by being in his presence......... yeah........before meeting him i didn't love football...... though it was for gays....... i realise now that i just didn't use to get it..........young jay ligga.......... has it all.......body and mind.......
us regular mortals........we should just shut up and drink our coffee and let the talent speak.....and we shut up......and watch.........like i was shut up while watching jayling having leant his head on the train window thinking his thoughts...... even thinking my thoughts...... and me thinking my thoughts as well.....in a retrospective mood but looking from the future.......i see a based goat before me....there is still time untill bloomth.....im glad I'm here to witness his maturation.......body and mind.........like wine.......

jay lingy he did use to become real angery when a defender dared to try to get the ball from him....of course they never could but... but Philly he ....... once he managed to touch the ball while Lingz was on it....yeah toepoked it.......lingo, well, he didn't appreciate that.. . .... usually ling used to take it easy in training.......but after that... he'd let Phil have it......and oh boy.......humiliating......Jess liked to make him crawl....yeah all fours....once while Philly was on the ground he stepped on his fingers, crushed them........MAKE ME A FUNNY FACE! You could hear the sound of fingerbones crackling as Lingard pressed his studs harder and harder. Phil was contorting his face in unimaginable ways, hoping to please Jesse enough to let go. Jesse finally released his hand but he was not done yet... Before Jones could stand up Jesse kicked him as hard as he could in the belly....... PLAY DEAD!...Jones collapsed in fetal position. But he could not play dead as he was shivering, struggling to hold in his vomit. PLAY DEAD!!!...and another forceful kick. Jones barfed. BITCH! LICK IT UP CUNT! LICK IT UP AND MAKE A FUNNY FACE!....... GOOD BOY! HAHAHAHAHAHAH! YEAH FUCKER! WHEN YOU'RE DONE WE'RE DOING A REPEAT! ALRIGHT??..... SAY YES MASTER!...yes master........THANK YOU MASTER JLINGZ...thank you master jaylingz.....THUD - another kick, right to the head.....jesse pulled a leash out of his back pocket and put it on Phil's neck and walked him around the training ground....dragged I should say........this went on while everyone was watching......they were saying amongst themselves.....yeah serves him right for trying to ruin jesses confidence by taking the ball from him........and that was that for the new maldini....that was that......

I guess when you work with people you...heh...get to know em......they may even... become your friends......jesse lingard he would walk to training with a teammate.... sometimes staff.... that's the kind of lad he is..... they would talk.....joke...heh....regular friend stuff.....but something's on his mind today thought big D James as he was sipping..tea...yeah they r allowt to have tea on the pitch......yeah jayboy ain't himself today no, no.....see, big D he had a real good intuition for this sorta stuff......he could usually tell if someone done stepped on a banana peel this morning and slipped....or stepped on a pin and his heel hurt...or maybe hit his head on the sink while washing his hair....heh...and got some soap on his nose...yeah soap looks cute on a nose....like milk on the moustache....heh....but i digress..... point is....you cant hide anything from DJ....but you don't want to anyway.... he always finds a way to make you feel better....heh...forget your troubles.....a boy with a soothing touch.....but that morning for the first time.....well....he doesn't know!....he can't tell whats goin on with jessy....jessboy's smile....it usually lit up the entire training compleks but now.... darkness....clouds.....yeah....DJ goes up to him....whats wrong jlingz...he dows the sign JmmL....but jay-o doesn't return the gesture like he usually been used to do..... can't you tell, big D?....nah jay...with the others it's easy....the contortions on their faces tell me all I need to know.....but your sadness... it's deeper.... it's in the heart....i am a magician with the ball yeah but I can't peer into....a man's deepest places..... then a lightning strike strikes the ground in the distance and it thunders throughout the complex...James then observes a tear...on the face of his teammate (jaylingz).....

sorry big D i didn't mean to startle you with that lightning....but I guess thats just what i do....yung jess..not only talented at scoring faking goals but also...at hurting others.....i didn't mean to do it danny boy....I didn't mean to make him cry...make who cry jessy? share with me this information...the defender, danny...see i was playing as usual and then...then I notice....a grown man danny....teared up because of me...i look around and see...a some of his teammates too....they are running and water drips behind them...but i didn't mean to make them cry like little babies big D...i didn't mean to...but i reckon....its like when a player scores a rebound own goal....he doesn't mean to do it either...but the goal stands you dig...it stands... it's the only thing that matters....and the only way to avoid that goal not to play danny...to not play.......yeah and then 10 lightnings struck at once and another 10 in succession to them...the team had surrounded jesse at that point...and the famous one...pogdab...he went and hugged jayling... rain falling....but pogdabs muscled body protected jesse from the wet...big P oggy he spoke....said...you didn't hurt them jess... it's not a bad thing for grown men to cry... it's healthy.... check youre phone's messaging app.... I've sent you a science article that proves this with peer reviewed studies.....so don't worry my friend....you helped them by making them cry...heh...they are probably thanking you right now in fact...jesse looked up to the sky.....being ensaddened he had closed himself off to the waves of energy flowing in the air....but he began to recieve them now....and he feel..signals from the men who cried.....thanks jessy...we feel more stable emotionally thanks to you...thanks friend..yes we consider ourselfs your friends now...we hope you see us as friends as well :)....jessys tears were now ones of joy....the sun was unclouded....the rain stopped and training resumed....jaylingz scored 1000 goals that day.
